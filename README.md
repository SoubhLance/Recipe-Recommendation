## 🎯 How It Works

### 1. **Data Collection & Processing**
- **Recipe Database**: 10,000+ curated recipes from various cuisines
- **Ingredient Analysis**: NLP processing of ingredient lists
- **Nutritional Data**: Calories, macros, dietary classifications
- **User Interactions**: Ratings, favorites, cooking history

### 2. **Recommendation Engine**
```python
# Simplified algorithm overview
def get_recommendations(user_ingredients, user_preferences, user_history):
    # Content-based filtering
    content_scores = match_ingredients(user_ingredients, recipe_database)
    
    # Collaborative filtering
    similar_users = find_similar_users(user_history, all_users)
    collab_scores = predict_ratings(similar_users, recipes)
    
    # Hybrid approach
    final_scores = combine_scores(content_scores, collab_scores)
    
    return ranked_recommendations(final_scores, user_preferences)
```

### 3. **Continuous Learning**
- **Feedback Loop**: User ratings improve future recommendations
- **A/B Testing**: Algorithm variants tested for optimal performance
- **Seasonal Adaptation**: Recommendations adjust based on time of year
